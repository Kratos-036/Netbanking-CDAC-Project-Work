- Had discussion with Rushikesh and Manthan but couldn't come to any final conclusion of use case or ER diagram

- Looked similar projects but no useful or functional project found (The ones we looked were very basic)

- Decided to have a meet on Saturday and Sunday for finalising 


Goals:

Saturday - Need to figure out all use cases and ER diagram complete and normalisation


Sunday - Refine yesterday's work and complete other formalities


Monday - Discuss with mentor and make any correction if needed in 6-7 PM only 

Tuesday - Project Evaluation
